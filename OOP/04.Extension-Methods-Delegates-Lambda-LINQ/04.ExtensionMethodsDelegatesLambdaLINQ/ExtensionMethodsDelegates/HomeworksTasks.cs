/* Lesson 4 - Extension-Methods-Delegates-Lambda-LINQ
 * 
 * Homework 1
 * 
 * Implement an extension method Substring(int index, int length) for the class 
 * StringBuilder that returns new StringBuilder and has the same functionality
 * as Substring in the class String.
 *  
 * 
 * Homework 2
 * 
 * Implement a set of extension methods for IEnumerable<T> that implement the
 * following group functions: sum, product, min, max, average.
 * 
 * 
 * Homework 3
 * 
 * Write a method that from a given array of students finds all students whose first 
 * name is before its last name alphabetically. Use LINQ query operators.
 * 
 * 
 * Homework 4
 * 
 * Write a LINQ query that finds the first name and last name of all students with 
 * age between 18 and 24.
 * 
 * 
 * Homework 5
 * 
 * Using the extension methods OrderBy() and ThenBy() with lambda expressions sort
 * the students by first name and last name in descending order. Rewrite the same
 * with LINQ.
 * 
 * 
 * Homework 6
 * 
 * Write a program that prints from given array of integers all numbers that are 
 * divisible by 7 and 3. Use the built-in extension methods and lambda expressions.
 * Rewrite the same with LINQ.
 * 
 * 
 * Homework 7
 * 
 * Using delegates write a class Timer that has can execute certain method at each t 
 * seconds.
 * 
 * 
 * Homework 8*
 * 
 * Read in MSDN about the keyword event in C# and how to publish events. Re-implement the
 * above using .NET events and following the best practices.
